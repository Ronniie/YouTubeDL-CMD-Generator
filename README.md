## YouTubeDL-CMD-Generator
Welcome.. I made this because I got tired of writing commands to download videos so yeah..

This is used for a popular content service provider which i'm not even sure if i'm allowed to list. DM me if you wanna know more.

Run `virtualenv venv` to create a virtual environment.
Following `source venv/bin/activate && pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.

#### There is one crucial step, please find your chrome version and execute the following command, `pip3 install chromedriver-binary==your_version` 

Then run `python3 main.py` to start the program.

After that, it'll ask you to enter the video url.

Follow the steps it prompts you, select the season you would like. 
The commands will go into `urls.txt` file.
Copy those commands into SSH terminal and run them.

That's all! Enjoy my laziness..
